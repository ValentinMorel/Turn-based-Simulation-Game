# Turn-based-Simulation-Game
Turn based Game sim written in C++ with ECS architecture

Some optimizations are missing: 

- Hard coded variables
- Headers that can be replaced with forward declarations
- No check on components when == nullptr
- Code repetition in Game class

That was a focus on architecture and good practices (interfaces, modular, easy-to-extend)
